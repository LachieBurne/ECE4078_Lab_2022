Steps for physical robot:

1. Run this while still connected to internet to download the model, it will be cached:
python3 TargetPoseEst.py

2. Connect to the pibot's wifi hotspot

3. Run:
python3 operateEst.py --ip IP_HERE --port 8080

NOTE1: Make sure you move and rotate the pibot with small movements, otherwise the ekf and robot will de-sync

NOTE2: Periodically save the SLAM map with 's', pause the ekf with 'enter' and run this command to check the slam score:
python3 mapping_eval.py --true-map MAP_HERE --slam-est lab_output/slam.txt

NOTE3: IF YOU GET A SLAM SCORE <0.03, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH, PRESS 'SPACEBAR' TO PAUSE THE MARKER MAPPING. If you want to keep going,
rename slam.txt so you don't overwrite it in-case the score goes up.

4. With a SLAM score < 0.03 and marker updating paused (by pressing 'spacebar'), begin taking photos of fruit with 'i'.

NOTE1: Try to take photos of fruit by themselves when possible. Get as many markers in frame as possible. 

NOTE2: Pay extra attention to fruit on the search list, and any fruit the robot will have to drive past when searching.

5. When you have taken enough photos, pause SLAM again with 'enter' and leave the gazebo open just in case you need to go back.

6. Run:
python3 TargetPoseEst.py

7. Check the fruit score with:
python3 mapping_eval.py --true-map MAP_HERE --target-est lab_output/targets.txt --target-only

NOTE1: Check each fruits error score and the average. A good average is anything < 0.1. 

NOTE2: If the average is somewhat high, check to see if there is one or two fruits with high error. If so,
delete the images of these fruit and take new ones in the sim. This is why it was left open.

NOTE3: IF YOU TAKE NEW PICTURES MAKE SURE TO RENAME THEM TO THE ONES YOU DELETED IN LAB_OUTPUT

8. Run:
python3 slamconverter.py --slam_map lab_output/BEST_SLAM_HERE --fruit_map lab_output/targets.txt

9. Run:
python3 operate_level2.py --map output_map.txt --search_list SEARCH_LIST_HERE --ip IP_HERE --port 8080

10. PRAY

NOTE1: If a run immediately looks bad, cut your losses and reset. The goal is to get as many runs in possible, we only need one good one.
