# ECE4078_Lab_2022
Repository for labs of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics) offered in 2022

You will work in groups to develop a fruit delivery robot. The groups will be assigned based on your answers to the CATME survey. More info about the lab project can be found on [Moodle](https://lms.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=139686&section=3).

You are not allowed to use information from the simulator back-end (e.g., true poses of objects extracted from Gazebo or information from the map generator script) or use ROS packages in your implementation. You are not allowed to teleport the robot or objects inside the simulator either. If you are found to do so you will get 0 for that milestone. Late submission penalty is 10% every work day on your mark for the milestone.

For each milestone, you will need to submit your implementation on Moodle before your lab session in the following week, and perform a live demonstration during the lab session in the following week. For example, M1's submission and live demo will be in week 3.

~~Working with the physical robot i and the assessments will be simulator-based. The lab sessions are hybrid. If you are coming in-person, please bring your own laptop and a headset so that you can join the Zoom sessions if needed. Please check your Moodle for information on which lab session you belong to.~~
