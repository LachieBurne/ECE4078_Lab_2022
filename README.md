# ECE4078_Lab_2022
Repository for labs of unit ECE4078 (Intelligent Robotics) offered in 2022

You will work in groups to develop a fruit searching robot. The groups will be assigned based on your answers to the CATME survey. There is also a [Pre-reqs knowledge quiz](https://lms.monash.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=10713718), please complete this before the CATME survey. More info about the lab project can be found on [Moodle](https://lms.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=139686&section=3).

You are not allowed to use information from the simulator back-end (e.g., true poses of objects extracted from Gazebo or information from the map generator script) or use ROS packages in your implementation. You are not allowed to teleport the robot or objects inside the simulator either. If you are found to do so you will get 0 for that milestone. Late submission penalty is 10% every work day on your mark for the milestone.

For each lab milestone, you will submit your code on Moodle. Each group needs to make one submission. If multiple people from the same group have made multiple submissions, the latest submission before the deadline will be graded. The demonstrators will run your code in the simulator for evaluation, which counts for 80% of your score for that milestone. During the lab session the week after a milestone, you will also be asked to demonstrate your solution to the milestone live in the lab. This live demo will count for 20% of your score for that milestone.
